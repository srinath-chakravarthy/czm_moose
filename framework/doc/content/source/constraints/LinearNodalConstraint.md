# LinearNodalConstraint

!syntax description /Constraints/LinearNodalConstraint

The LinearNodalConstraint class constrains the slave node to move as a linear combination of master nodes. Master node ids and corresponding weights are taken as input along with the slave node set or slave node ids. This nodal constraint can be enforced either using the penalty formulation or the kinematic formulation.
